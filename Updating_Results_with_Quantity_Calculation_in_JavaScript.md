### Introduction

This documentation explains the `updateResultsWithQuantityCalculation` function, which updates product results with quantity calculations based on the comparison of `purchasePrice` and `previousPurchasePrice` in the provided `frontendProductData`. The function checks if both current and previous prices exist for the same product and marks the corresponding product result as "quantity calculated" if the prices differ.

---

### Code Explanation

The `updateResultsWithQuantityCalculation` function iterates over the `frontendProductData`, checking each product's `purchasePrice` and `previousPurchasePrice` against the existing results. If both prices exist for the same `productId` and they are different, the corresponding result is flagged as `isQuantityCalculated`.

#### `updateResultsWithQuantityCalculation` Function
```javascript
const updateResultsWithQuantityCalculation = (results, frontendProductData) => {
  frontendProductData.forEach(frontendProduct => {
    const { productId, purchasePrice, previousPurchasePrice } = frontendProduct;

    // Check if both the current purchasePrice and previousPurchasePrice exist in the results for the same productId
    const purchasePriceExists = results.some(result =>
      result.productId === productId && result.purchasePrice === purchasePrice
    );

    const previousPurchasePriceExists = results.some(result =>
      result.productId === productId && result.purchasePrice === previousPurchasePrice
    );

    // If both prices exist and they are different, mark the result as quantity calculated
    if (purchasePriceExists && previousPurchasePriceExists && purchasePrice !== previousPurchasePrice) {
      results.forEach(result => {
        if (result.productId === productId && result.purchasePrice === purchasePrice) {
          result.isQuantityCalculated = true;
        }
      });
    }
  });

  return results;
};
```

**Explanation**:
- **Purpose**: To update the `results` array by marking certain products as `isQuantityCalculated` based on price changes between the current `purchasePrice` and `previousPurchasePrice`.
- **Logic**:
    - **Check for Price Existence**: For each product in `frontendProductData`, it checks whether both `purchasePrice` and `previousPurchasePrice` exist in the `results` for the same `productId`.
    - **Mark Quantity Calculation**: If both prices exist and are different, it updates the `results` for the corresponding `productId` with the `isQuantityCalculated` flag set to `true`.

### Real-World Example

In an inventory management system, this function can be used to identify products where quantity needs to be recalculated based on price changes. By comparing the current and previous prices for a product, the system can decide which results need to be flagged for quantity recalculation.

#### Example Data
```javascript
const results = [
  { productId: 1, purchasePrice: 50, isQuantityCalculated: false },
  { productId: 1, purchasePrice: 40, isQuantityCalculated: false },
  { productId: 2, purchasePrice: 30, isQuantityCalculated: false },
  { productId: 2, purchasePrice: 25, isQuantityCalculated: false }
];

const frontendProductData = [
  { productId: 1, purchasePrice: 50, previousPurchasePrice: 40 },
  { productId: 2, purchasePrice: 30, previousPurchasePrice: 25 }
];
```

#### Calling the Function
```javascript
const updatedResults = updateResultsWithQuantityCalculation(results, frontendProductData);
console.log(updatedResults);
```

#### Output:
```json
[
  { "productId": 1, "purchasePrice": 50, "isQuantityCalculated": true },
  { "productId": 1, "purchasePrice": 40, "isQuantityCalculated": false },
  { "productId": 2, "purchasePrice": 30, "isQuantityCalculated": true },
  { "productId": 2, "purchasePrice": 25, "isQuantityCalculated": false }
]
```

**Comment**:
- Products with a price change are marked with `isQuantityCalculated: true`.
- Only the results with matching `purchasePrice` are updated, and the corresponding flag is set accordingly.

### Similar Problem Questions

#### Question 1:
**How can we efficiently update multiple product records based on conditional comparisons between new and old data?**

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  Use a function like `updateResultsWithQuantityCalculation` to iterate through the new product data and compare it with the existing records. Apply conditional logic to update the relevant fields where discrepancies are found.
</details>

#### Question 2:
**How do we handle cases where only certain products meet the update conditions, and not all of them need changes?**

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  Implement logic to selectively update records based on the presence of certain conditions (e.g., price changes), ensuring that only the relevant entries are modified.

### Output and Comments

```javascript
const updatedResults = updateResultsWithQuantityCalculation(results, frontendProductData);
console.log(updatedResults);
```

**Comment**:
- The function successfully updates the `results` by marking products where the `purchasePrice` and `previousPurchasePrice` differ, setting `isQuantityCalculated: true` for these products.
